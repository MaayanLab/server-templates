# appyter

This template is for building an Appyter which is a jupyter notebook-based web application. It is most useful if you have a jupyter notebook already and want to rapidly turn it into a simple web application without needing to use any javascript.

## Quick start
```
cookiecutter gh:maayanlab/server-templates --directory appyter
```
